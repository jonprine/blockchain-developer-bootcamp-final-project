## Avoid Common Attacks

# Protection from Reentrancy Attack
- `nonReentrant()` is used to protect the escrow balance within the contract.

# Modifiers
- modifiers used to specify functions only available to either artist or purchaser.

# Require
- `require` used throughout the contract to specify certain states have been met before a function can execute.
